> This was a game I made a couple years ago (hence lack of /src and good code/commit formatting) following [this raycasting tutorial](https://youtu.be/ECqUrT7IdqQ?si=lNja0eLVciibl5d7) for a "2.5D" games in PyGame. I decided to repurpose it into a Backrooms style horror game since it was what I was interested in at the time.

This mini project has been archived a long time ago since its "completion". I'm only uploading it now to give this game a place to rest and be showcased. You are welcome to fork this and make the changes you see fit!

## Installation
You need the following:
  - PyGame library
  - Python

To run it, you just need to run ```main.py``` in the same directory as all the other files (keeping resources and everything else in the same location) in the terminal (or VSCode)
