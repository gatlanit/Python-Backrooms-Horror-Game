# Python-Backrooms-Horror-Game
A 2.5D Python "backrooms" style horror game made using raycasting techniques 

> This was a game I made a couple years ago (hence lack of /src and good code/commit formatting) following [this raycasting tutorial](https://youtu.be/ECqUrT7IdqQ?si=lNja0eLVciibl5d7) for a "2.5D" games in PyGame. I decided to repurpose it into a Backrooms style horror game since it was what I was interested in at the time.
